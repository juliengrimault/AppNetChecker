			<Abstract type="html">* Defines the implementation of aspect \a NAME. The aspect can contain any
* number of methods following the form:
*
* @code
+ (void)advise:(void (^)(void))body;
- (void)advise:(void (^)(void))body;
* @endcode
*
* The name of the method (\c advise: in the example) specifies the pointcut, or
* how the advice is applied to an instance or class. The following pointcuts
* are currently defined:
*
* @li \c advise: is invoked for every method that is called on the object.
* @li \c adviseGetters:property: is invoked for every invocation of a property getter on the object, and is passed an \c NSString naming the property which is being retrieved. This will not intercept calls to methods declared without \c \@property.
* @li \c adviseSetters:property: is invoked for every invocation of a property setter on the object, and is passed an \c NSString naming the property which is being set. This will not intercept calls to methods declared without \c \@property.
* @li \c advise&lt;Selector&gt;: is invoked for every invocation of \c selector, which must take no arguments, on the object.
* @li \c advise:&lt;selector:&gt; is invoked for every invocation of \c selector on the object. The advice method is passed all of the arguments to that invocation, but cannot modify them.
*
* If a method would satisfy multiple pointcuts above, the one furthest down the
* list (the most specific) is chosen; the other matches are not used.
*
* In all cases, \c self and \c _cmd are respectively the object and the
* selector upon which the advice is being applied. Explicitly invoking \c _cmd
* against \c self from within an advice method will result in undefined
* behavior.
*
* @warning It is undefined behavior to invoke a method against \c super.</Abstract>
