# TwitApp.net

This project was originally a playground that I was using to learn about [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) and put in practise some TDD methodology using [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi).
It turned out that I managed to build something vaguely useful so I decided that I would polish it and put it in the App Store once I am happy with it.

I haven't currently released the app as it is not yet ready, I would say I am about 80% there.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to get started:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/juliengrimault/AppNetChecker


## Why is this open source?
It is intended to be a source of sample code for everyone starting out with ReactiveCocoa and/or Kiwi.

Obviously, if you want to help out and fix some bugs or show me how things could be improved, I'll love you forever :)


## License

TwitApp.net is released under the [Simplified BSD License](https://github.com/juliengrimault/AppNetChecker/blob/master/License).

While it is not strictly forbidden by the license, I would greatly appreciate it if you didn't redistribute this app exactly the way it is in the App Store. There's nothing stopping you, but please don't be a jerk.
